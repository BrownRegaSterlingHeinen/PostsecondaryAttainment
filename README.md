# Postsecondary Attainment: Identifying Areas to Improve Retention and On-Time Graduation Rates for North Carolina Community Colleges

This repository contains work done by Master of Science in Data Science students at Southern Methodist University Noelle Brown, Matthew Rega, Lizzy Sterling, and John Heinen along with their advisor, Dr. Jake Drew. The purpose of this project is to aim to identify leading factors in why 1/3 of students do not return for their second year of community colleges in North Carolina and those factors that also contribute to students not graduating on time. This project is inspired by the John M. Belk Endowment's vision to build “a stronger North Carolina where all residents have access to and complete postsecondary educational pathways that help them realize their career goals aligned with our state’s workforce needs ([Source](http://jmbendowment.org/what-we-fund/)).”
