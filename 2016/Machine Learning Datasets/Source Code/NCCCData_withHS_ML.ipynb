    "This notebook reads in the merged data file located [here](https://github.com/BrownRegaSterlingHeinen/PostsecondaryAttainment/blob/master/RawDatasets/mergedData.xlsx) as input data. A lot of the code used in this notebook is from Dr. Jake Drew's repository for North Carolina public school data which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC/tree/master/2017/Machine%20Learning%20Datasets). This creates a dataset that is preprocessed for Machine Learning by going through the following transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Columns that have the same value in every single row are deleted.\n",
    "- Nominal columns that have a unique value in every single row (all values are different) are deleted.\n",
    "- Empty columns (all values are NA or NULL) are deleted.\n",
    "- Numeric columns with more than the percentage of missing values specified by the missingThreshold parameter are deleted.\n",
    "- Remaining numeric columns with missing values are imputed / populated with the mean of the column.  \n",
    "- Categorical / text based columns with > uniqueThreshold unique values are deleted.\n",
    "- Duplicated or highly similar columns with > 95% correlation are delelted."
